# Cost Savings with Intune: Web-based Microsoft 365 Apps

## Introduction
Many companies face pressure to reduce costs, and one way to do so is by adjusting Microsoft 365 licenses. Instead of using the full desktop versions of Office applications, a company can switch to the web-based versions. This significantly lowers licensing costs. Microsoft Intune offers an efficient way to manage this transition by making web apps easily available to users.

## Advantages of a Web-based Implementation
- **Lower Licensing Costs**: Using only web versions of Office apps means that less expensive licenses (such as Microsoft 365 F3 or Business Basic) are sufficient.
- **Simpler Management**: There is no need to install Office apps, which reduces IT maintenance.
- **Accessibility**: Users can work from anywhere without software installation, as long as they have a browser.

## Implementation in Intune
With Intune, administrators can quickly make web applications available by adding desktop shortcuts for the web versions of Microsoft 365 apps.

1. Go to the **Microsoft Intune Admin Center**.
2. Navigate to **Devices** > **Windows** > **Configuration**.
3. Click on **Create (Policy)**.
4. Choose **Platform**: *Windows 10 and later*.
5. Choose **Profile type**: *Settings catalog*.
6. Click on **Create** and fill in the basic information.

### Step 2: Configure Web Apps

### Step 3: Apply JSON Configuration
Enable **Configure list of force-installed Web Apps** and fill in the field **URLs for Web Apps to be silently installed (Device)** with the following JSON:

```json

  {
    "create_desktop_shortcut": true,
    "default_launch_container": "window",
    "url": "https://outlook.office.com/mail"

  {
    "create_desktop_shortcut": true,
    "default_launch_container": "window",

  }
]
```

### Step 4: Finalize the Policy
